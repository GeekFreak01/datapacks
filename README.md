# Voidcraft Data Pack (Minecraft 1.21.7+)

This pack adds a renewable path to shulker shells without harming shulkers. Craft **The Void** (Structure Void) and use it to produce shells.

## Features
- Craftable **The Void** block from obsidian and an echo shard.
- Convert **The Void** + chorus fruit + ender pearl into **2× shulker shells**.
- Automatically unlocks the custom recipes for every player (via `load`/`tick` functions), following the structure of the bundled Useful Mobs datapack.

## Recipes
1. **The Void (Structure Void)**
   - Shape: full obsidian ring with an echo shard in the center (8 obsidian + 1 echo shard).
2. **Shulker Shells**
   - Shapeless: The Void + chorus fruit + ender pearl → 2 shells.

## Installation
1. Copy this folder into your world save under `datapacks/`.
2. Launch the world (1.21.7+) and ensure the pack is enabled with `/datapack list`.

Enjoy farming shulker shells sustainably!
